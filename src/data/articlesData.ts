    title: 'Beehive Drones Unveils Indonesia‚Äôs First Emission-Detecting Marine Drone',
    dateUpload: '03 Juni 2024',
    images: ['/article/1.png'],
    content: [
        'In collaboration with Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) and the Indonesian Classification Bureau (BKI), Beehive Drones has developed Indonesia‚Äôs first marine-sniffing drone‚Äîan innovative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to detect shipborne air emissions. Officially launched on Tuesday (28/5), the drone is equipped with real-time data capabilities and a suite of advanced features that enhance its accuracy and operational functionality, marking a major step forward in environmental monitoring technology in Indonesia.',

'The BVD-M16A sniffing drone is a versatile UAV built primarily to detect airborne greenhouse gas emissions. Equipped with sophisticated sensors, it can identify and measure concentrations of seven key pollutants‚ÄîCO‚ÇÇ, CO, NO‚ÇÇ, NO, SO‚ÇÇ, PM2.5, and PM10‚Äîin real-time via the putaradar.id platform. This functionality supports regulatory bodies such as BKI and the Port Authority (KSOP) in enforcing ship standardization and monitoring port operations, contributing to broader national efforts to reduce air pollution.',

'Beyond emission detection, the BVD-M16A also functions as a surveillance tool. It features both thermal and RGB cameras for monitoring activities in maritime areas. Its Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) radar enhances object detection and distance measurement, ensuring safe navigation and collision avoidance.',

'Designed with maritime environments in mind, the drone includes a floater system that enables seamless take-off and landing from water surfaces, even in choppy sea conditions. With an operational range of up to 20 kilometers, the drone is suitable for both coastal and open-sea missions. Its buoyant and stable construction was rigorously tested to ensure reliable performance in aquatic settings.',

'After undergoing comprehensive tests for sniffing, surveillance, and water operations, the BVD-M16A proved capable of meeting all expectations‚Äîdemonstrating its readiness for commercialization and real-world deployment.',

'The drone operates by sampling ship exhaust or emissions from dockside areas and feeding the captured particles into its onboard BVD-Sniffing sensor system. These sensors analyze the pollutants and transmit the processed data to the cloud, where users can view it via a dedicated dashboard interface.',

'Nanang Afandi, Head of Sea Transport and Port Traffic at the Directorate General of Sea Transportation, expressed optimism about the tool‚Äôs potential. He noted that the drone could significantly support KSOP in monitoring ship emissions at Tanjung Perak Port and hoped it would see broader use across the country to help achieve Indonesia‚Äôs net-zero emissions target by 2060. He emphasized that adopting this kind of technology is a vital step toward reducing pollution and preserving the¬†environment.',

    title: 'TKDN: Indonesia‚Äôs Bold Push for Local Industry ‚Äì Golden Opportunity or Hidden Burden?',
    dateUpload: '02 July 2025',

    content: [
        'What if Indonesia could power its industries with more local components‚Äîcutting reliance on imports, boosting jobs, and strengthening its economy? That‚Äôs the dream behind TKDN, or the Domestic Component Level policy.',

        'TKDN is Indonesia‚Äôs way of saying: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs build with what we have.‚Äù The regulation pushes industries to use more locally sourced materials in their production process. It‚Äôs a national strategy to grow homegrown capabilities, boost competitiveness, and promote economic independence.',
        'But for many companies, the path isn‚Äôt easy.',
        
        '‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt want to use local materials,‚Äù says Manda, founder of Beehive Drones, a Yogyakarta-based drone tech startup. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that they‚Äôre just not up to the mark‚Äîyet.‚Äù',
        
        'In the high-precision world of drones, quality is everything. Sensors, processors, and lightweight composite materials often need to meet international standards‚Äîand many simply aren\'t available locally. As a result, companies like Beehive Drones are caught in a balancing act between supporting national policy and staying globally competitive.',
        
        'Still, Beehive Drones has taken steps to align with the TKDN vision. Its flagship product, the BVD-V25 Surveillance Drone, has received an official TKDN certification of 41.19%, reflecting a growing commitment to integrate local components wherever possible.',
        
        'The challenges don‚Äôt stop at raw materials. Indonesia also faces a talent gap. High-tech manufacturing demands engineers skilled in AI, navigation systems, and precision hardware‚Äîtalents that are still rare across the local workforce. To meet TKDN, companies often need to invest heavily in training and tech transfer, increasing both time and costs.',
        
        'Still, There‚Äôs a Bigger Picture',
        'Despite these growing pains, TKDN has its rewards. It drives local production, fuels domestic innovation, and creates real jobs. Companies that embrace it may receive government incentives, easier access to big national projects, and funding support.',
        
        'In short? TKDN isn‚Äôt just a regulation‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement.',
        'But to make it work, industry and government need to join forces. That means:',
        '1) Investing in local supply chains',
        '2) Building talent through education and industry partnerships',
        '3) Offering tax breaks, subsidies, and support for producers',
        '4) Encouraging global collaboration for technology transfer',
        'If done right, TKDN could unlock a powerful future for Indonesia‚Äîwhere local industries thrive, global standards are met, and the country takes a stronger seat in the world economy.',
        
        'The big question isn‚Äôt whether TKDN is a burden or an opportunity.',
        'It‚Äôs whether we‚Äôre ready to invest in making it work.',
